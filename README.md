# Element React

![](https://travis-ci.org/eleme/element-react.svg?branch=master)

[Element](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element) was initially written in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), which has many elegant UI components, but we also love [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), so we forked it for the React community.

## Getting Started

We have not finalized all of the components, we also welcome community contributions.

## Contributing

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/eleme/element-react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.
