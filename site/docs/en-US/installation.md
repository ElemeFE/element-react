## Installation

### NPM
Installing with npm is recommended and it works seamlessly with `webpack`.

```shell
npm i element-react --save
```
### Theme
Before the building, you need a style theme, here we recommend you to pick up `element-theme-default`.

```shell
npm install element-theme-default --save
```
